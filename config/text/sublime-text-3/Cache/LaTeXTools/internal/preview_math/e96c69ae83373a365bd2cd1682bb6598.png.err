Cluster centers are the optimal measured metrics that are close to all the measured metrics of each cluster and are computed using \refeq{centers}.
\Equation{centers}{\mathbf{v}_{j}=\left[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_{ij}^{m} \mathbf{x}_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_{ij}^{m}}\right], \forall j \sim \mathbf{V}_{t}=G_{\partial}\left(\mathbf{U}_{t-1}\right)}

\subsection{Objective function:}

	The objective of the \ac{FCM} algorithm is to find a set of membership values U and a set of cluster centers V that minimize the objective function in

Our simulation has 3 components.
The first component is a LoRa transmiter and receiver tool wich represent the end-devices.
To generate the QoS metrics offred by each setting,
	we transmite packets with deffirent parameters presented in \reftab{lora_settings}
	it converts the quantitative values of \ac{LoRa} transmission performance to qualitative values that represent level of membership to each \ac{FL} subsystem.
The second component is a \ac{GA} Component,
	it aims to update the values of \ac{MCDM} to converge to a stable values that represent the final membership values.
The third component is a \ac{MCDM}.
	it is a matrix of n setting over k applications,
	their values represent the membership of each setting to each application.
	when the value is equal to one,
	this means that the corespondent setting fits well the application that belongs to.







% %---------------------------------------------------------------------

% The \ac{FCM} algorithm is a class of adaptive stochastic optimization algorithms involving search and optimization.
% Beside the \ac{FCM} advantages that are related in literature,
% our decision to use \ac{FCM} was based on the nature of our objective functions that have several dynamic and stochastic aspects,
% where any other derivative-based optimization method cannot perform well.
% Another important issue that encouraged the selection of \ac{FCM} to our problem is the high interaction between different variables.
% Since the \ac{ADR} is a multi criteria problem in nature,
% 	different QoS metrics need to be optimized.

% In this paper,
% three different objective functions are proposed to cover the different and opposite objectives and requirements of applications in terms of QoS.
% The proposed objective functions are outlined in the following points.

% The different steps of the selection process could be summarized as follow:

% When studying a parameter all the other parameters and operators are kept constant.
% Only a sample for the experiments results achieved is given in this paper as shown in \reftab{hgfd}.

% \subsection{Objective function}

% In general,
% clustering algorithms are classified into two categories,
% hard clustering algorithms and fuzzy clustering algorithms.
% Each object in hard clustering belongs to one and only one cluster.
% On the contrary,
% in the fuzzy clustering each object is allowed to have membership functions to all clusters rather than exactly one cluster.
% Mathematically,
% a fuzzy clustering problem can be represented as an optimization problem

% In this paper we use the fuzzy clustering to map a set of settings to clusters applications that need such settings to operate well..


% \Equation{1a}{\min _{W, Z} F(W, Z)=\sum_{l=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{l i}^{x} d\left(\mathbf{z}_{l}, \mathbf{x}_{i}\right)}
% such that
% \Equation{1a}{0 \leq w_{l i} \leq 1, \quad 1 \leq l \leq k, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n}
% \Equation{2a}{\sum_{l=1}^{k} w_{l i}=1, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n}
% \Equation{3a}{0<\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{l i}<n, \quad 1 \leq l \leq k}

% where:
% \Itemize{
% \item  n is the number of possible configurations $x_{i}$ with 1<i<n.
% \item  k is the number of applications (clusters) $c_{l}$ with 1<l<k.

% \item  d is the number of metrics $a_{j}$ of each object $x_{i}$ with 1<j<d.
% \item  c is the number of metrics categories (physical, mac) $c_{m}$ with 1<m<c.

% \item  A={$A_{1}$, ..., $A_{d}$} is a set of categorical attributes with $A_{(1<j<d)}$={$a_{j1}$, ..., $a_{jc}$}

% \item  D={$x_{1}$, ..., $x_{n}$} is a set of n objects.
% \item  D={$x_{1}$, ..., $x_{n}$} categorical data set with $x_{(1<i<n)}$ \in $A_{(1<j<d)}$

% \item  $Z_{l}$={$z_{l1}$, ..., $z_{ld}$} is a set of cluster centers.

% \item  W=$w_{li}$ is a k x n fuzzy membership matrix.
% \item  \alpha \in[1, ] is a weighting exponent.
% % \item  d($z_{l}$, $x_{i}$) is a certain distance measure between cluster center $z_{l}$ and the object $x_{i}$.
% }


% The objective function starts with an initial values of W,
% then repeatedly iterates between estimating cluster centers Z given W and estimating the membership matrix W given Z until two successive values of W or Z are equal.

% that is,
% users who are assigned to a network of their preference ($P_{u}$ ):
% since the algorithm considers multiple criteria,
% it may assign a user to a network different from his/her original preference.
% $P_{u}$ is considered appropriate for performance evaluation from the user point of view.
% To maximize $P_{u}$ ,
% the objective function ObjFun1 shown in Algorithm 1 is used.




% The weights of the input criteria {$W_{v}$,
% $W_{s}$,
% $W_{t}$,
% $W_{u}$} have been encoded using real encoding method.
% The length of the real-valued encoding is 4 real floating numbers.
% The length of each floating number depends on the internal precision and roundoff used by the computer to define the precision of the floating numbers.
% The results achieved by extensive comparisons of GA performance as a function of the different GA parameters (i.e.,
% the population size,
% the mutation rate,
% and the crossover fraction) and the different GA operators (i.e.,
% the selection and crossover operators) have been summarized by [27].


% They have concluded that crossover fraction,
% selection operator,
% and crossover operator are not of much importance.
% On the other side,
% the population size and the mutation rate have the most significant impact on the ability of the GA to find better minimum value for objective function.
% Based on that,
% several sets of experiments to determine good population size and mutation rate for our proposed objective functions have been carried out.
% Each experiment has been repeated several iterations while the performance is recorded.
% The results from all the iterations are then combined by calculating the average (and standard deviation) for each experiment.
% Usually,
% testing GAs includes mainly two issues;
% how far the result obtained by GA is from the benchmark results,
% which can be measured by average fitness value.
% The second issue is how fast GA is in finding the best solution,
% which can be measured by the total number of function evaluations.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
