Dea Aghiles,

For references 1,2,5, the access date has to appear at the end...after 
the link write, accessed on Aug. 2019

I see that the acronyms are clickable..is that done automatically by 
LaTex? Since they don't redirect anywhere else, they shouldn't be clickable

Please have these done and upload the camera ready on the publisher's site

Follow the instructions from the Camera Ready link, available on the 
conference site, to upload the camera ready and copyright.
Please remove all security protections, as the publisher should add 
footnotes and header.

Regards,
Melanie

            <p>Dear Aghiles,</p>
            <p>Are you using LaTex? If yes, then leave the word Index
              terms instead of Keywords<br>
            </p>
            <p>The keywords need to be italicized as well <br>
            </p>
            <p>The acronyms should not be in a larger font or italicized</p>
            <p>Figure captions should be in a smaller font <br>
            </p>
            <p>Do not italicize urls in the references. Also, please
              make sure that for online reference you have the urls (ref
              5 doesn't have it)</p>
            <p>Section 4 needs to be called Experiments and also within
              the paper change from experimentation to experiments.<br>
              Also regarding this section, add a few more sentences
              regarding the experiments and if you have some results. I
              understand this is a poster, but there should be some more
              information. I believe more than one reviewer asked for a
              few more details since there is very little information
              regarding the algorithm and experiments</p>
            <p>Please look over the content related reviews and add more
              information to clarify them</p>
            <p>Email me the new version when done<br>

                      <div>     This article proposes a multi-criteria
                        decision system based on a genetic algorithm to
                        select the best LoRa transmission configuration.</div>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <div>The topic is interesting and the paper is
                        well written.</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>However, the paper only presents the high
                        level architecture of their solution. The
                        authors claim to have implemented their solution
                        and also tested the performance using NS3. If
                        so, it would have been more interesting to get
                        preliminary performance results for example
                        instead of two pictures that provide few
                        information. Also, the paper is titled Genetic
                        Algorithm For LoRa Transmission Parameter
                        Selection. Nevertheless, there is very few
                        information about the genetic algorithm (in the
                        abstract only). You shouls take extra space and
                        details it.</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>Nonetheless, I think this poster can launch
                        an interesting discussion during the conference.
                        Thus I suggest to accept it.</div>

                    <div>
                      <div>This paper proposed a tuning method (for
                        choosing the configurations) based on genetic
                        algorithm for optimizing data transmission
                        performance in IoT applications.</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>I have the following concerns and questions:</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>1) As mentioned in the paper, the current
                        inefficiency is mainly "due to the lack of tools
                        that could take both applications requirements
                        and external environment", if this is the case,
                        i.e., environment factors are involved, I wonder
                        if reinforcement learning methods would have
                        done better than genetic algorithms?! A
                        discussion is useful</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>2) It would be better if the effects of each
                        of the four parameters could be explained. How
                        would their changes affect the transmission
                        performance? Some profiling results would be
                        appreciated in camera-ready version</div>

                      <div>The paper deals with the Trasmission
                        parameter selection problem in heterogeneous
                        networks of IoT devices based on LoRa
                        technology. Authors propose a genetic algorithm
                        to select the transmission parameters needed by
                        the application, considering application
                        requirements and external environment. Authors
                        present an experimental platform composed by
                        real boards and ns-3 simulator; are there some
                        preliminary results than can be provided in
                        camera-ready version? This will be great.</div>
                      <br>
                      <div>Furthermore, authors should consider only one
                        manner to refer to LoRa technology: in some
                        cases, it is written like "Lora."</div>

                    <div>The authors applied genetic algorithm to find
                      the optimal parameters for LoRa transmission,
                      which is a crucial problem in IoT research. They
                      tested three types of applications, namely text,
                      voice, and image transmission. In addition to
                      using a simulator (NS-3), the authors tested on
                      real environment using Rasberry-pi and Arduino.
                      The organization and presentation of the paper is
                      very good. Contribution is appropriate for a
                      poster. Image quality in Figure should be improved
                      in the final version.</div>

                    <div>
                      <div>The idea to use genetic algorithms to select
                        transmission parameters sounds interesting, but
                        from the submission, I cannot see how you
                        implemented that. Although it is only a poster,
                        at least some preliminary evaluations or some
                        details about the implementation of the genetic
                        algorithm should be presented.</div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                      <div>Also you should defend some of your claims
                        better, e.g., that the diversity of LoRa Gateway
                        models make SNR measurement complicated. SNR
                        also typically stands for "signal-to-noise
                        ratio". Some rferences are not acceptable in
                        this form: CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw? Maybe this
                        is a part of some URL?</div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                      <div>The references section does not use a uniform
                        font, some blank areas/white spaces exist in the
                        entries. Some author given names are written
                        completely, others not. GA and FL are not
                        formatted a ADR and SNR etc. in the text.</div>

                    <div>
                      <div>Why do you mention 868 MHz? WAN is using 433
                        MHz using LoRa?</div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                      <div>In the conclusion you state that you measured
                        something. But it is neither shown nor explained
                        in the poster, no figures, no tables, no text.
                        Also the three applications/services you mention
                        are not defined. What are they using? What are
                        their characteristics? This would be important
                        for the context of the ICSNC in my opinion.
