>>
>> I have the following concerns and questions:
>>
>> 1) As mentioned in the paper, the current inefficiency is mainly "due to

e
>> involved, I wonder if reinforcement learning methods would have done bet=

>> 2) It would be better if the effects of each of the four parameters coul=

e?
>> Some profiling results would be appreciated in camera-ready version
>>

>>
>> The paper deals with the Trasmission parameter selection problem in
>> heterogeneous networks of IoT devices based on LoRa technology. Authors
>> propose a genetic algorithm to select the transmission parameters needed=
 by

>> environment. Authors present an experimental platform composed by real

e
>> provided in camera-ready version? This will be great.
>>
>> Furthermore, authors should consider only one manner to refer to LoRa

>>
>> ------------------
>>
>> =3D=3D reviewer 4 =3D=3D
>>
>> The authors applied genetic algorithm to find the optimal parameters for
>> LoRa transmission, which is a crucial problem in IoT research. They test=
ed
>> three types of applications, namely text, voice, and image transmission.=
 In
>> addition to using a simulator (NS-3), the authors tested on real
>> environment using Rasberry-pi and Arduino. The organization and
>> presentation of the paper is very good. Contribution is appropriate for =
a
>> poster. Image quality in Figure should be improved in the final version.

>>
>> =3D=3D reviewer 5 =3D=3D
>>
>> The idea to use genetic algorithms to select transmission parameters
>> sounds interesting, but from the submission, I cannot see how you
>> implemented that. Although it is only a poster, at least some preliminar=
y
>> evaluations or some details about the implementation of the genetic
>> algorithm should be presented.
>>
>> Also you should defend some of your claims better, e.g., that the
>> diversity of LoRa Gateway models make SNR measurement complicated. SNR a=
lso
>> typically stands for "signal-to-noise ratio". Some rferences are not
>> acceptable in this form: CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw? Maybe this is a part=

>> some URL?
>>
>> The references section does not use a uniform font, some blank
>> areas/white spaces exist in the entries. Some author given names are
>> written completely, others not. GA and FL are not formatted a ADR and SN=
R
>> etc. in the text.
>>
>> Why do you mention 868 MHz? WAN is using 433 MHz using LoRa?
>>
>> In the conclusion you state that you measured something. But it is
>> neither shown nor explained in the poster, no figures, no tables, no tex=
t.

the

>>
>> The submission contains a lot of spelling errors. "in wireless sensor
>> network_s_". "in _an_ edge computing"? "to be selected to match better"
>> "these five last years". "i.e." has to be followed by a comma.

>> The 6720 configuration options in the abstract are not clarified. They
>> are "explained" later in the paper, but in the abstract its unclear what=

>> The paper formatting needs some adjustments:
>>
>>
>> !! Correct the title; it is written using different font type and size =

>> see template - Use 14 point Times New Roman in Bold
>>
>>
>> !! Eliminate all page numbers

>>
>> !! add, after Abstract
>> !! Keywords-text; text; text.
>> !! ALL keywords must be Bold and Italic
>> !! no more than 4-5 keywords
>>
>>
>> !! Avoid starting or ending a section using a figure or a table;
>> introduce some text at the beginning of a new section, before a
>> table/figure; introduce some text at the end of a section, after a
>> table/figure; correct: Figure 1, Figure 2
>>
>>
>> !! use a uniform figure capture, e.g., "Figure 1. The proposed scheme...=
"
>> !! Apply to all

>>
>> !! Use 8 point Times New Roman for ALL (table and figure) captions.
>>
>>
>> !! Figure 1 is not mentioned in text. Please, introduce explicit

>>
>> - The references must use the correct format (abbreviated-firstname
>> lastname):

=C2=A0 This article proposes a multi-criteria decision system based on a ge=
netic algorithm to select the best LoRa transmission configuration.</div><b=
r><br><div>The topic is interesting and the paper is well written.</div><br=
><div>However, the paper only presents the high level architecture of their=
 solution. The authors claim to have implemented their solution and also te=
sted the performance using NS3. If so, it would have been more interesting =
to get preliminary performance results for example instead of two pictures =
that provide few information. Also, the paper is titled Genetic Algorithm F=
or LoRa Transmission Parameter Selection. Nevertheless, there is very few i=
nformation about the genetic algorithm (in the abstract only). You shouls t=
ake extra space and details it.</div><br><div>Nonetheless, I think this pos=
ter can launch an interesting discussion during the conference. Thus I sugg=
est to accept it.</div><br><div>Other comment:</div><div>there is 6720 poss=

div>=3D=3D reviewer 2=C2=A0 =3D=3D</div><br><div><div>This paper proposed a=
 tuning method (for choosing the configurations) based on genetic algorithm=
 for optimizing data transmission performance in IoT applications.</div><br=
><div>I have the following concerns and questions:</div><br><div>1) As ment=
ioned in the paper, the current inefficiency is mainly &quot;due to the lac=
k of tools that could take both applications requirements and external envi=
ronment&quot;, if this is the case, i.e., environment factors are involved,=
 I wonder if reinforcement learning methods would have done better than gen=
etic algorithms?! A discussion is useful</div><br><div>2) It would be bette=
r if the effects of each of the four parameters could be explained. How wou=
ld their changes affect the transmission performance? Some profiling result=
s would be appreciated in camera-ready version</div></div><br><div>--------=
--------------</div><br><div>=3D=3D reviewer 3 =3D=3D</div><br><div><div>Th=
e paper deals with the Trasmission parameter selection problem in heterogen=
eous networks of IoT devices based on LoRa technology. Authors propose a ge=
netic algorithm to select the transmission parameters needed by the applica=
tion, considering application requirements and external environment. Author=
s present an experimental platform composed by real boards and ns-3 simulat=
or; are there some preliminary results than can be provided in camera-ready=
 version? This will be great.</div><br><div>Furthermore, authors should con=
sider only one manner to refer to LoRa technology: in some cases, it is wri=
tten like &quot;Lora.&quot;</div></div><br><div>------------------</div><br=
><div>=3D=3D reviewer 4 =3D=3D</div><br><div>The authors applied genetic al=
gorithm to find the optimal parameters for LoRa transmission, which is a cr=
ucial problem in IoT research. They tested three types of applications, nam=
ely text, voice, and image transmission. In addition to using a simulator (=
NS-3), the authors tested on real environment using Rasberry-pi and Arduino=
. The organization and presentation of the paper is very good. Contribution=
 is appropriate for a poster. Image quality in Figure should be improved in=
 the final version.</div><br><div>--------------------</div><br><div>=3D=3D=
 reviewer 5 =3D=3D</div><br><div><div>The idea to use genetic algorithms to=
 select transmission parameters sounds interesting, but from the submission=
, I cannot see how you implemented that. Although it is only a poster, at l=
east some preliminary evaluations or some details about the implementation =
of the genetic algorithm should be presented.</div></div><br><div><div>Also=
 you should defend some of your claims better, e.g., that the diversity of =
LoRa Gateway models make SNR measurement complicated. SNR also typically st=
ands for &quot;signal-to-noise ratio&quot;. Some rferences are not acceptab=
le in this form: CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw? Maybe this is a part of some UR=
L?</div></div><br><div><div>The references section does not use a uniform f=
ont, some blank areas/white spaces exist in the entries. Some author given =
names are written completely, others not. GA and FL are not formatted a ADR=
 and SNR etc. in the text.</div></div><br><div><div>Why do you mention 868 =
MHz? WAN is using 433 MHz using LoRa?</div></div><br><div><div>In the concl=
usion you state that you measured something. But it is neither shown nor ex=
plained in the poster, no figures, no tables, no text. Also the three appli=
cations/services you mention are not defined. What are they using? What are=
 their characteristics? This would be important for the context of the ICSN=
C in my opinion. Please revisit and add some figures.tables/explanations</d=
iv><br><div>The submission contains a lot of spelling errors. &quot;in wire=
less sensor network_s_&quot;. &quot;in _an_ edge computing&quot;? &quot;to =
be selected to match better&quot; &quot;these five last years&quot;. &quot;=
i.e.&quot; has to be followed by a comma.</div></div><br><div>The 6720 conf=
iguration options in the abstract are not clarified. They are &quot;explain=
ed&quot; later in the paper, but in the abstract its unclear what is meant.=
