*********************************************************************************
The ICIN conference, established in 1989 and praised for the high quality of its
technical program and richness of its social networking, is also recognized for
its continuous adaptation to emerging technical trends.
 
The year 2020 will be a keystone in the evolution toward the networks of the
future, with the first commercial deployments of large-scale 5G infrastructures,
the increasing interest in network intelligence and machine learning techniques
applied to network management and orchestration, the progress of precision
networking technologies toward low-latency services, and the end of the Horizon
2020 research framework program in Europe superseded by the next Horizon Europe.
 
In this scenario and considering the many challenges that the aforementioned
paradigms and technologies will bring, ICIN 2020 will focus on:
 
"Beyond 5G: building network sense"
 
The conference will foster new ideas and novel approaches to future service
delivery in a smart network environment, able to show what could be qualified as
sense, “a sane and realistic attitude to situations and problems”, according to
Oxford Dictionary. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current
state of the art and promote the advances of network management and orchestration
technologies.
 
ICIN 2020 aims at providing an international forum for researchers and
practitioners from academia, industry, network operators, and service providers
to discuss and address the challenges posed by innovation in clouds, Internet and
networks. Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel
technical studies as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions
that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and
implementation experiences, and demonstrate innovative use-cases are especially
encouraged.
 
**********************************************************************************
ICIN 2020 solicits original, unpublished work not currently under review by other
conferences or journals. Papers submitted to ICIN 2020 will be assessed based on
originality, technical soundness, clarity and interest to a wide audience. All
submissions must be written in English and must use standard IEEE two-column
conference template, available for download from the IEEE website:
 
https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html
 
Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process and all submissions must
be done electronically through EDAS using the following link:
 
https://edas.info/N26190
 
Technical papers can be of two types: full papers or short papers, up to 8 pages
and 5 pages respectively, including tables, figures and references. Demo papers
of length of 3 pages are also solicited.
 
At least one author is required to register, at the full rate, to present
accepted papers at the conference and for the paper to appear in the conference
proceedings.
 
The best technical papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit
an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:
    - IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 4.682)
    - MDPI Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.031)
Extended versions of ICIN 2020 papers must include at least 30% of new material
(algorithms, results, related work) compared to the conference version.
Particularly innovative and visionary papers will be invited to submit a
tutorial-style, magazine version for fast-track review in:
    - IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 10.356)
