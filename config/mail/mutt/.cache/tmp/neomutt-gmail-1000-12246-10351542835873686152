Dear Steve,

Did you receive my email ?

>> This article proposes a multi-criteria decision system based on a genetic algorithm to select the best LoRa transmission configuration.
>>
>> The topic is interesting and the paper is well written.
>> However, the paper only presents the high level architecture of their solution. The authors claim to have implemented their solution and also tested the performance using NS3. If so, it would have been more interesting to get preliminary performance results for example instead of two pictures that provide few information. Also, the paper is titled Genetic Algorithm For LoRa Transmission Parameter Selection. Nevertheless, there is very few information about the genetic algorithm (in the abstract only). You shouls take extra space and details it.
>> Nonetheless, I think this poster can launch an interesting discussion during the conference. Thus I suggest to accept it.

>> == reviewer 2 ==
>> This paper proposed a tuning method (for choosing the configurations) based on genetic algorithm for optimizing data transmission performance in IoT applications.
>> I have the following concerns and questions:
>> 1) As mentioned in the paper, the current inefficiency is mainly "due to the lack of tools that could take both applications requirements and external environment", if this is the case, i.e., environment factors are involved, I wonder if reinforcement learning methods would have done better than genetic algorithms?! A discussion is useful
>> 2) It would be better if the effects of each of the four parameters could be explained. How would their changes affect the transmission performance? Some profiling results would be appreciated in camera-ready version
>> ----------------------
>> == reviewer 3 ==
>> The paper deals with the Trasmission parameter selection problem in heterogeneous networks of IoT devices based on LoRa technology. Authors propose a genetic algorithm to select the transmission parameters needed by the application, considering application requirements and external environment. Authors present an experimental platform composed by real boards and ns-3 simulator; are there some preliminary results than can be provided in camera-ready version? This will be great.
>> Furthermore, authors should consider only one manner to refer to LoRa technology: in some cases, it is written like "Lora."
>> ------------------
>> == reviewer 4 ==
>> The authors applied genetic algorithm to find the optimal parameters for LoRa transmission, which is a crucial problem in IoT research. They tested three types of applications, namely text, voice, and image transmission. In addition to using a simulator (NS-3), the authors tested on real environment using Rasberry-pi and Arduino. The organization and presentation of the paper is very good. Contribution is appropriate for a poster. Image quality in Figure should be improved in the final version.
>> --------------------
>> == reviewer 5 ==
>> The idea to use genetic algorithms to select transmission parameters sounds interesting, but from the submission, I cannot see how you implemented that. Although it is only a poster, at least some preliminary evaluations or some details about the implementation of the genetic algorithm should be presented.
>> Also you should defend some of your claims better, e.g., that the diversity of LoRa Gateway models make SNR measurement complicated. SNR also typically stands for "signal-to-noise ratio". Some rferences are not acceptable in this form: CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw? Maybe this is a part of some URL?
>> The references section does not use a uniform font, some blank areas/white spaces exist in the entries. Some author given names are written completely, others not. GA and FL are not formatted a ADR and SNR etc. in the text.
>> Why do you mention 868 MHz? WAN is using 433 MHz using LoRa?
>> In the conclusion you state that you measured something. But it is neither shown nor explained in the poster, no figures, no tables, no text. Also the three applications/services you mention are not defined. What are they using? What are their characteristics? This would be important for the context of the ICSNC in my opinion. Please revisit and add some figures.tables/explanations
>> The submission contains a lot of spelling errors. "in wireless sensor network_s_". "in _an_ edge computing"? "to be selected to match better" "these five last years". "i.e." has to be followed by a comma.
>> The 6720 configuration options in the abstract are not clarified. They are "explained" later in the paper, but in the abstract its unclear what is meant.
